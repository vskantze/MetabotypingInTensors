# MetabotypingInTensors

This is the accompanying MATLAB-code for the paper "Identification of metabotypes in complex biological data using tensor decomposition". 
The code reproduces the figures from the paper with a simulated dataset. This workflow can be applied to any metabolic tensor data to identify metabotypes.

NOTE: the figures and tables will not reproduce the exact results of the paper due to the way the simulated data (metabolomics_data.mat, clinical_data.mat) were produced.
The original data can not be included publicly  in this code due to privacy reasons. However, the attached simulated data can be used as a means to know how the workflow is constructed and should be used.
